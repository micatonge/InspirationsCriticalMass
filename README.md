I've been very interested in Japan's 2020 Olympics. Ever since I heard about a man-made meteriote show, its peeked my interest. Japan is one of the fastest growing technology driven countries. From provision of vending machines containing clothes and shoes, to E-TAF automatic doors that open shifting accordingly to your body shape; the Japanese incorporate technology into their everyday lives. 
In the 2020 Olympics, they have announced that they will have robots assist guests to their seats, provide information and carry their items. I find this inspiring because it will help normalize the use of robots and hopefully inspire people around the world to look at robots as a part of our future.

Rebound is a command-line tool that instantly fetches Stack Overflow results when you get a compiler error. This program is so universal and applicable to all. I use Stack Overflow almost everyday. This program will help with time and is much more efficient. I find it so inspiring because it is so applicable. It deserves alot more recognition.
